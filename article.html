                    <p>Anxiety can leave you feeling overpowered, exhausted, and incapable to function at your best. Current anxiety treatment choices can result in serious side effects. Hence, the anxiolytic properties of CBD might offer hope to many. But does CBD works for anxiety?</p>
                    <p>Current studies appear that CBD has anxiety-reducing properties, and advanced studies will be able to show how compelling CBD may be as an anxiolytic. Best CBD for anxiety induces its outcomes in the body by way of interacting with your endocannabinoid system. It also interacts with serotonin receptors, which in turn may want to help to decrease your tension stages.
                        Serotonin is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a key position in mood regulation. you could have heard of serotonin called the “happy hormone” due to its potential to improve temper and impart emotions of happiness. Serotonin’s impact on temper is so strong that it is a treatment for problems like despair and anxiety.</p>
                    <p>A clinical study was made to investigate the effectiveness of CBD as an anti-anxiety treatment. Either 300 mg of CBD or a placebo were given to the participants daily for four weeks. Measurement of anxiety symptoms was provided at the start and end of the treatment period. The results found that the CBD treatment managed to reduce anxiety in the participants significantly. The authors concluded that CBD oil could be an effective treatment option for anxiety [1].</p> 
                    <p>Another clinical study involved people with anxiety disorder. Participants received either CBD or a placebo before undergoing the public speaking test. The authors of the study observed a significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety, intellectual impairment, speech problems during the use of CBD. People who received a placebo experienced worsening cardiovascular symptoms, changes in skin condition, and psychological signs of anxiety. Participants receiving CBD did not experience these negative effects [2].</p>

                    <h3 class="article__title article__title--min">Сbd dosage for anxiety</h3>
                    <p>What is the optimal cbd dosage for anxiety? How much CBD for anxiety should I use?

The anti-anxiety effects of CBD in such dosage were demonstrated in some significant research.
